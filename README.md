# Vantiq Stream SDK demo (plain javascript
This is a demo app to create a reactive web app using vantiq stream sdk.

It needs a vantiq server side service. I created a namespace `mt_sdk_stream_demo` and a token for test.

## Run
Clone this repository, and install the lib with npm.
```
git clone https://github.com/Mavlarn/vantiq-stream-sdk-demo
npm install
```

And run with:
```
npm run serve
```
